Credits :
MythB - for stats 
sobydamn - for rank system

Modification :
-added KD (kill/death ratio) with rank 

-and PRO OR NOOB tag according to that KD

New with rank system and stats===================
simple put these files and dependencies(membersid.py) in scripts folder. 


Migrating from rank to kd system===================
just use prefix-tag.py ....
you might already have stats and rank scripts installed
just check the path of stats.json and rank/toprank.py  and modify path in  prefix-tag.py 


and yes need to remove old tag scripts .. or copy paste code to your old scripts (for modders).
